## Overview

or $500 on numbers 0-36. Additionally, the standard "outside" bets are
featured as well that allow a player to bet on even numbers, odd numbers,
colors, or groups of numbers. The player begins with $1000 as their balance.
The payout for bets involving evens, odds, colors, or halves is 1:1. The
payout for the column or dozen bets is 2:1. Payout for bets on a single
number are 35:1.

## User Interface
The GUI features the following:
- The roulette betting area in the center.
- The betting chip selection area in the bottom left.
- The action notifier area in the top.
- The balance counter in the bottom right.
- The clear chips and spin buttons in the bottom right.

The player will first select which chips they would like use and then they
can begin placing bets on the table. By default, the player starts with $1
chips. When the player is ready to find out how lucky they are, they will
click on the "SPIN" button. When the ball lands on a random number, the
dealer will take all the chips that did not win. The chips that won any of
the player's bets will remain on the table, allowing for the player to bet
with the same positions. The "CLEAR" button will return the chips on the
table to the player. The roulette tutorial for how to play the game is found
in the menu bar and the player also has the option to save their balance so
they can play again later with their winnings.

## Extra Features
- The player will be able to save their game balance so that they can
  continue playing later with whatever winnings they have earned.
- All graphics seen inside the GUI frame were custom made using Photoshop.

## Implementation Notes
The extra feature to save/load profiles uses an external folder named
"Accounts" which is created in the same directory as the jar file upon
first using the save feature.
